                ... is very good at being a business advisor. I've been fortunate enough for him to work with me and for me to know him for a few years. When I was working towards launching and running my business (Big Bucket Cleaning LLC) he always asked me the right question at the right time. Its really amazing how we can be talking about the business and the issues I'm having and he is able to direct all my issues back to one or two things that I need to address. I highly recommend him.
